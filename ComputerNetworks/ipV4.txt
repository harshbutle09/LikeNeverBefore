IP stands for Internet Protocol version v4 stands for Version Four (IPv4), is the most widely used system for identifying devices on a network. It uses a set of four numbers, separated by periods (like 192.168.0.1), to give each device a unique address. This address helps data find its way from one device to another over the internet.

IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the ARPANET in 1983. IP version four addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation. Example- 192.0.2.126 could be an IPv4 address.
What is an IP Address?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes:

    Identification: It uniquely identifies a device on a network.
    Location Addressing: It indicates where a device is located within a network, making data routing possible.
